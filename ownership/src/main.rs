#![allow(unused_variables)]
/*
 *
 * Notes:
 * Rust ownership follows the following 3 rules:
 *  1. Any value has a variable which is its owner
 *  2. There can only be 1 owner at a time
 *  2. Value is dropped when the variable goes out of scope
 *
 * Question:
 *  - How do we do things like passing mutable references to a lot of users.
 *  e.g. how event_manager, process_util, zoo_client, etc. were shared by various
 *  objects in a system. In other words, how do we work around the
 *  lack of "shared ownership" of a value.
 * Answer(?): via the Mutex type, which allows mutations to shared data, but the
 *  mutex API enforces ordering of mutations.

fn main() {
    // String is can be mutable type, and its size is unknown at compile time.
    // It is therefore stored on the heap.
    let mut s = String::from("hello");
    s.push_str(", world!"); // push_str() appends a literal to a String
    println!("{}", s); // This will print `hello, world!`
                       // Whenever we talk of memory management, it is about memory used on the heap.
                       // Memory used by a variable on the stack is automatically freed when it goes
                       // out of scope.
                       // Memory management could be:
                       //  1. garbage collected. e.g. python
                       //  2. manual; e.g. C
                       //  3. automatic, but known at compile type: Rust, C++ smart ptrs

    // In rust, references to objects on the heap can't be copied, only moved.
    // Example:
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1;
    // println!("This will not compile: {}", s1);
    println!("This is valid: {}", s2);
    //
    // To create a deep copy of a value allocated on the heap, use the clone method.
    // Question: Is clone present for all values that can be heap allocated??
    // Example:
    let s1 = String::from("hello"); // Shadows previous s1.
    let s1: String = String::from("Hello");
    // We can add Copy trait to a type to denote that value of that type should be
    // copied instead of moved when assigned to another variable.
    // Copy and Drop are traits that can be implemented by custom types
    // Copy Trait cannot be added to a type if that type, or any of its parts, has
    // impelemented the Drop trait.
    // Scalar types implement Copy.

    // Just like assignements to variables, non-Copyable values are moved when passing
    // values as function arguments or returning from functions.
    let s1 = gives_ownership(); // gives_ownership moves its return
    let s2 = String::from("hello"); // s2 comes into scope.
    let s3 = takes_and_gives_back(s2); // s2 is moved into
                                       // takes_and_gives_back, which also moves its return value into s3.
                                       // on function return, s3 goes out of scope and is dropped. s2 goes out of scope but was
                                       // moved, so nothing happens. s1 goes out of scope and is dropped.

    // return value into the function
    // that calls it.
    let some_string = String::from("hello"); // some_string comes into scope.
    some_string // some_string is returned and
                // moves out to the calling
                // function.

fn read(y: bool) {

// The boxed array has now been bound to both a and b. By our "almost correct" principle, 
// Rust would try to free the box's heap memory twice on behalf of both variables. That's undefined behavior too!

// To avoid this situation, we finally arrive at ownership. When a is bound to Box::new([0; 1_000_000]), 
// we say that a owns the box. The statement let b = a moves ownership of the box from a to b.

// Box deallocation principle (fully correct): If a variable owns a box, when Rust deallocates the variable's 
// frame, then Rust deallocates the box's heap memory.

// In the example above, b owns the boxed array. 
// Therefore when the scope ends, Rust deallocates the box only once on behalf of b, not a.

// Collections use Boxes


// Moved heap data principle: if a variable x moves ownership of heap data to another variable y,
// then x cannot be used after the move.
// So using the {first} after it has moved the ownership of the variable

    name.push_str(" Jr.");

}

// first points to deallocated memory after calling add_suffix. 
// Reading first in println! would therefore be a violation of memory safety (undefined behavior). 
// Remember: it's not a problem that first points to deallocated memory. It's a problem that we tried to use first after it became invalid.
